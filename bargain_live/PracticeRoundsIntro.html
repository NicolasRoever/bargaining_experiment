In this experiment, you are assigned the role of <b>{{ role_in_game }}</b> and this role will remain the same throughout the entire experiment.
Before the experiment begins, you will complete three practice rounds. The main purpose of these practice rounds is to help you become familiar with the environment. No practice round will count toward the final payment. Please read the instructions for each practice round carefully.
