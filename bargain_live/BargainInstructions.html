<p>Please read these instructions carefully. The payment you will receive from this experiment depends partly on your decisions, partly on the decisions of others, and partly on chance. The amount you earn will be paid electronically via PayPal.</p>

{% if player.role == "Buyer" %}
<p>The experiment consists of 20 matches. You are the <b>buyer of an object for all 20 matches.</b> At the beginning of each match, you will be randomly paired with another participant who is the seller</p>
{% elif player.role == "Seller" %}
<p>The experiment consists of 20 matches. You are the <b>seller of an object for all 20 matches.</b> At the beginning of each match, you will be randomly paired with another participant who is the buyer.</p>

<h2>Main Negotiation Task</h2>
<hr>
{% if player.role == "Buyer" %}
<div style="background-color: rgb(249, 249, 249); padding: 10px;">
<p>In each match, the buyer and seller trade an object. <b>The value of the object for the seller is always 0.</b> The product's value for you - the buyer - will be randomly drawn between 0 and 60 euros before every match. Your oppnent - the seller - does not know your value. Negotiation will happen on the following screen, and the text below further explains your options:</p>

<p>In each match, the buyer and seller will be asked to trade an object. <b>The value of the object for you - the seller - is always 0.</b> The product's value for the buyer will be randomly drawn between 0 and 60 euros before every match. However, you do not know this specific value. Negotiation will happen on the following screen, and the text below further explains your options:</p>

    <h3><i><u>Price Negotiation</u></i></h3>
    <p>The buyer and seller negotiate the price. During the negotiation, both participants can submit a price. Once a participant clicks the "Submit" button, the chosen price is displayed to the other participant. Either party can revise their price as often as they want during the negotiation. The revised price is displayed on the participant's screen and remains valid until it is changed.</p>

    <p>Upon receiving the submitted price from the participant in the opposite role, you can choose to accept their most recent offer at any time. If either participant accepts the other’s price, the match ends, and the product is traded at the accepted price. The price negotiation can continue for up to two minutes and will automatically end after that time.</p>

<div style="background-color: rgb(249, 249, 249); padding: 10px;">
    <h3><i><u>Costs You Incur</u></i></h3>
    The total costs you incur are given by: 
    <p class="equation">Total Costs = Negotiation Cost + Delay Costs</p>
    <h4>1. Negotiation Cost</h4>
    <p>Negotiation costs (you can think of costs for lawyers needed for a negotiation) are incurred for each second of the negotiation. The longer the negotiation, the higher the cost. The total accumulated negotiation costs first rise rather quickly at first and more slowly in the end. You can see the shape of the function in the screenshot above in the left graph titled “Negotiation Cost”. 

    <h4>2. Delay Costs</h4>
    <p>For each second of the negotiation, the trade is delayed. This is also costly (think of a manufacturing plant which can only produce later because the raw materials are delivered later). The later you trade, the higher this cost. This is reflected by a reduction in the gains from trade by a percentage value. The current reduction is presented to you in the right graph titled “Cost of Time Delay” (the green bar shows the percent you can keep, the red bar shows the cost).</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<hr>

<div style="background-color: rgb(249, 249, 249); padding: 10px;">
<p> At any point in time, you have three options: (i) submit a new price, (ii) terminate the negotiation, and (iii) accept the opposite trader’s price (only available after the opposite trader submits their first price). In the end, we randomly select one match to determine your payment for the experiment.

Here is an example for how your final payoff is calculated: If the price you negotiated is 31€ and your valuation is 68€, and you reach the agreement after some time, which results in delay (costing 30% of the gains from trade) and transaction costs (in this example 0.1€), the payoff is:</p>

<p>
  <div class="statement">
   <div>Value of the Object: <span class="amount"> 68 </span></div>
   <div>Price: <span class="amount"> -31</span></div>
   <div class="line"></div>
   <div>Gains from Trade: <span class="amount">37</span></div>
   <div class="line"></div>
   <div>Cost of Delay: <span class="amount">(-30% * 37)= -11</span></div>
   <div>Transaction Costs: <span class="amount">-0.1</span></div>

   <div>Payoff from Match: <span class="amount">24.8</span></div>
